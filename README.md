## Worst of the web

## For the type font I chooses a font family that had atleast 5 weight types, I went with "Prompt" I use the font weigh of 200 300, 500, 700 Since the website on the about page had a lot of text content, I broke the paragraphs in to sections adding line height, left alignment, padding and margins and grid layouts for spacing and placenent.


## I made all my links "bold" using a heavier font weight of 300-700, I wanted to keep the paragraphs text consistent without using colors links. I also adding css propeties to add ;hover a color or underline on so it could look like it it clickable.

##I use 5 color in total, green and neatural colors like black, white, and tan.
